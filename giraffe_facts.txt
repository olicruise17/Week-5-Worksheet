Giraffe Facts

1. Giraffes are the tallest land animals, with males reaching heights of up to 18 feet and females up to 14 feet!
2. A giraffe's neck can be as long as 6 feet, but it still only has seven neck vertebrae—just like humans.
3. Their tongues can be up to 20 inches long and are a unique bluish-black color, which helps prevent sunburn while they feed on leaves.
4. Giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period, making them some of the least sleep-dependent mammals.
5. Each giraffe’s coat pattern is unique, similar to human fingerprints.
6. Giraffes are herbivores, mainly eating leaves, shoots, and fruits of various trees and shrubs, especially acacia trees.
7. Baby giraffes are around 6 feet tall at birth, and they can stand and walk within an hour of being born!
8. Despite their long necks, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans—just much larger ones.
9. They are native to Africa and live in savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands.
10. A giraffe's heart can weigh up to 25 pounds and generate double the blood pressure of most other large mammals to pump blood up its long neck.
11. Giraffes have a distinctive gait known as “pacing,” where they move both legs on one side of their body at the same time, which gives them a unique, smooth movement.
12. Giraffes don’t drink water very often. Instead, they get most of their hydration from the leaves they eat.
13. When giraffes do drink, they have to spread their legs wide apart to lower their long necks down to the water.
